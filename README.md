Abstract: Immunodominant and highly conserved flavivirus envelope proteins can trigger cross-reactive IgG antibodies against related flaviviruses, which shapes subsequent protection or disease severity. This study examined how prior dengue serotype 3 (DENV-3) infection impacts subsequent Zika virus (ZIKV) plasmablast responses in rhesus macaques (n=4). We found that prior DENV-3 infection was not associated with diminished ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies or magnitude of plasmablast activation. Rather, characterization of 363 plasmablasts and their derivative 177 monoclonal antibody supernatants from acute ZIKV infection, revealed that prior DENV-3 infection was associated with a differential isotype distribution towards IgG, lower somatic hypermutation, and lesser B cell receptor variable gene diversity as compared to repeat ZIKV challenge. We did not find long-lasting DENV-3 cross-reactive IgG after a ZIKV infection, but did find persistent ZIKV-binding cross-reactive IgG after a DENV-3 infection, suggesting non-reciprocal cross-reactive immunity. Infection with ZIKV after DENV-3 boosted pre-existing DENV-3-neutralizing antibodies by 2-3-fold, demonstrating immune imprinting. These findings suggest that the order of DENV and ZIKV infections impact the quality of early B cell immunity which has implications for optimal immunization strategies.
