*Abstract:* Immunodominant and highly conserved flavivirus envelope proteins can trigger cross-reactive IgG antibodies against related flaviviruses, which shapes subsequent protection or disease severity. This study examined how prior dengue serotype 3 (DENV-3) infection impacts subsequent Zika virus (ZIKV) plasmablast responses in rhesus macaques (n=4). We found that prior DENV-3 infection was not associated with diminished ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies or magnitude of plasmablast activation. Rather, characterization of 363 plasmablasts and their derivative 177 monoclonal antibody supernatants from acute ZIKV infection, revealed that prior DENV-3 infection was associated with a differential isotype distribution towards IgG, lower somatic hypermutation, and lesser B cell receptor variable gene diversity as compared to repeat ZIKV challenge. We did not find long-lasting DENV-3 cross-reactive IgG after a ZIKV infection, but did find persistent ZIKV-binding cross-reactive IgG after a DENV-3 infection, suggesting non-reciprocal cross-reactive immunity. Infection with ZIKV after DENV-3 boosted pre-existing DENV-3-neutralizing antibodies by 2-3-fold, demonstrating immune imprinting. These findings suggest that the order of DENV and ZIKV infections impact the quality of early B cell immunity which has implications for optimal immunization strategies.

DEFINITION OF VARIABLES IN REPOSITORY
Each row represents heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain variable region data from a single plasmablast. VH contains the VDJ sequence. VL contains the VJ sequence. NA or No D indicates missing information or annotation due to low quality genomic sequence.

rhesus_ID = the animal identifier and day of plasmablast sampling post challenge (D), separated by an underscore (_). This defines the analytic groups of the study: Primary ZIKV (12016_D7 and 11046_D10), secondary ZIKV-ZIKV (12016_D74 and 11046_D73), secondary DENV3-ZIKV (11029_D6 and 13036_D9)
IgH_ID = heavy chain ID
H_CLEAN_VDJ_SEQ = VH nucleotide sequence obtained
H_VGENE = VH V gene annotation based on the VH sequence obtained
H_DGENE = VH D gene annotation based on the VH sequence obtained
H_JGENE = VH J gene annotation based on the VH sequence obtained
H_MUT_FREQ = somatic hypermutation frequency in the VH (must multiply by 100 to achieve a percentage)
H_CDR3_LEN_AA = length of the complementarity determining region 3 in the VH (units are number of amino acids)
H_CONST = short sequence of VH constant region used for isotype inference
ISOTYPE = constant region isotype of the VH 
LC = kappa or lambda constant region of the VL
IgL_ID = light chain ID
L_CLEAN_VJ_SEQ = VL nucleotide sequence obtained
L_VGENE = VL V gene annotation based on the VL sequence obtained
L_JGENE = VL J gene annotation based on the VL sequence obtained
L_MUT_FREQ = somatic hypermutation frequency in the VL (must multiply by 100 to achieve a percentage)
L_CDR3_LEN_AA = length of the complementarity determining region 3 in the VL (units are number of amino acids)
